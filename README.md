This project was done as a part of the inhouse projects offered to the students by Mahindra University.

It is a simple weather app which can either take the location from web services, if the browser supports it and the permission for the same was given. 
An alternate way of entering the place is by the search bar provided for the same.

The application fetches the current weather data using the openweathermap api and uses it to display the current weather. 

openweathermap api: current weather data
